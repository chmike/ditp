# Distributed Information Transport Protocol

**Work in progress**: may change any time.

The Distributed Information System (DIS) is intended to be a
world wide CRUD database. Stored data may be of any type.
The information are referenced by a Distributed Information
Reference (DIR). See this [README](dir/README.md) for a
short description of DIS and DIR.

Information Data Representation (IDR) is the DIS and DITP
data encoding standard. A low level encoding package has
been implemented and benchmarked with the
[Alec Thomas Go serialization benchmarks](https://github.com/alecthomas/go_serialization_benchmarks).
